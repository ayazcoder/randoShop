Hi, I've completed the tasks and put in my best effort to finish them within a day. However, I encountered some network issues and weekday commitments which occupied my time.

For this website, I utilized several technologies including React.js, Tailwind CSS, Formik, Yup, Context API, `useNavigate()`, React Router DOM, React Toastify, Axios, and others.

In this project, I covered various aspects including:
0) Components reusability
1) Designing an elegant user interface.
2) Implementing animations for smooth transitions and enhancing user experience.
3) Integrating backend APIs into the frontend.
4) Performing CRUD operations.
5) Implementing "Add to Cart" functionality using local storage.
6) Setting up global states and functions for making API calls.
7) Organizing API routes into separate objects.

Additionally, I incorporated some extra features:
1) Implemented form validation for adding items.
2) Introduced category sections in the item listing to facilitate filtering based on categories.
3) Implemented a search filter allowing users to search for items by their name, price, or category.
3) Implemented real-time data updates, so CRUD operations reflect immediately without the need to refresh the site.
